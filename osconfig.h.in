 * \brief The maximum size of task local storage
 *
 * Only when the operating system is RTEMS, this define is used.
 * Task local storage (TLS) is memory local to a task.  TLS stores
 * variables which exist once for each task as for example errno.
 *
 * In RTEMS the task stack, TLS and the floating point context - if
 * floating point support is enabled - share the same memory area.
 * Therefore, when providing static or pre-allocated stack memory
 * to OS_TaskCreate() (or functions which indirectly invoke
 * OS_TaskCreate()), the memory must be large enough to hold the
 * stack and TLS plus the floating point context.  The later is only
 * needed if flag OS_FP_ENABLED is provided to OS_TaskCreate() or
 * set with OS_ADD_TASK_FLAGS.  This means, the actual size available
 * for a stack is the value of the stack_size argument minus
 * OS_MAX_TLS_SIZE and, if enabled, minus CONTEXT_FP_SIZE.
 *
 * Note that the actual TLS size of an RTEMS executable is defined by
 * the linker and the CONFIGURE_MAXIMUM_THREAD_LOCAL_STORAGE_SIZE
 * configuration option of RTEMS.  OS_MAX_TLS_SIZE must be larger
 * or equal to the maximum of these two values.  The actual TLS size
 * of an RTEMS executable can queried with an RTEMS tool as in this
 * example:
 *
 *     rtems-exeinfo -T core-cpu1.exe
 *
 * The value must be an integral multiple of OS_TASK_STACK_ALIGNMENT.
